# Qasa css test

I chose React CSS Modules because I like the syntax. How styling is structured is something I've rarely had an opinion about. The important thing to me is to remain consistant.
Besides that I optized exclusively for speed. So I set up a gobal state machine, and ended up with much too large components and generic styles. Naming could easily be significantly improved as well.
Most of my time was spent reading https://www.sneakersnstuff.com's styling to make sure I didn't diverge too much from their design in my haste. Even ended up copying their grid. I also chose not to animate anything.
